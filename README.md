<b>Twitter 1Click Block Extension</b>
<br>
Block annoying people on Twitter with a single click!  
<br>
An extension already exists on the Chrome Web Store but it is old, glitchy, and uses JQuery ðŸ˜¨
<br>
<blockquote>Works on Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge..)</blockquote>

## Preview
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Wqj4W0Z.png" />

* Works on all tweets, no confirmation dialog
* Fits perfectly as if it had always been there
* Adjusts to the different Twitter light/dark/dim colors
* No API calls or anything else

## How to install
**[Chrome Docs â€” Loading an unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked)**  
> Should be the same for others Chromium-based browsers except the `chrome://extensions` link (e.g. replace `chrome` by `brave`)

## TODO
- [ ] Use TypeScript
- [ ] Fix block button showing on own tweets in "reduced" size (like mobile)
